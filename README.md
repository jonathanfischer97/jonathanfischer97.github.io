# Jonathan Fischer's Website

This repository contains the source for my personal website hosted on GitHub Pages at [jonathanfischer.org](https://jonathanfischer.org). The goal is to keep the site clean and minimal while still advertising myself. 

I'm a 5th year PhD candidate in the Department of Biophysics at Johns Hopkins University. I'm advised by Dr. Margaret Johnson, and my work primarily involves modeling biochemical oscillators and simulating them with a variety of methods. I'm also a Julia language enthusiast.
